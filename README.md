# XDN: Stateful Service Delivery Network on the Edges

XDN is a research project that eases developers to deploy stateful web service in the cloud edge to provide lower latency. XDN embraces a declarative approach where you only need to describe _what_ characteristics your service has and _what_ consistency guarantees your client wants, not _how_ to replicate your service in the edge. You do not need to understand Raft, Multi-Paxos, or ZAB protocols to enjoy a linearizability consistency guarantee, XDN handles the deployment for you :)

This project is still under development.
